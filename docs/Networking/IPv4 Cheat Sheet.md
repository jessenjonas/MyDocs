# IPv4 Cheat Sheet

Internet Protocol version 4 or IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP).  
IP is one of the core protocols for standards-based internetworking that is used on the Internet and other packet-switched networks.

## Address Length and Format

IPv4 uses a 32-bit address space that provides 4,294,967,296 unique addresses.  
Addresses are expressed in dot decimal notation which consists of four octets of the address expressed individually in decimal numbers and separated by periods.  
The following are some examples of IPv4 address expressed in dot decimal notation, and their binary representations:

| Dot Decimal   | Binary                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 122.25.88.196 | 01111010.00011001.01011000.11000100  |
| 10.56.2.2     | 11000111.00111010.00111010.00000001  |
| 199.58.58.1   | 11000111.00111010.00111010.00000001  |

IPv4 uses the concept of a subnet mask to separate an address into the network portion and the host portion, giving IPv4 its hierarchical structure.

## Methods to Assign IPv4 Addresses

**Static** - Fixed Address,  
**DHCP** - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (Address assigned by a central DHCP server).
