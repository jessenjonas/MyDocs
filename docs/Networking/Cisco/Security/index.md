## Local and Remote Access
- **Local Access:** All network infrastructure devices can be accessed locally. Local access to a router usually requires a direct connection to a console port on the Cisco router, and using a computer that is running terminal emulation software, as shown in the figure. The administrator must have physical access to the router and use a console cable to connect to the console port. Local access is typically used for initial configuration of the device.
- **Remote access:** Administrators can also access infrastructure devices remotely, as shown in the figure. Although the aux port option is available, the most common remote access method involves allowing Telnet, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, or SNMP connections to the router from a computer. The computer can be on the local network or a remote network. However, if network connectivity to the device is down, the only way to access it might be over telephone lines.
